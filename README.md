# Tic Tac Toe Game with Vue.js and TypeScript

This repo contains a Vue.js project built with TypeScript for a school assignment in the advanced JavaScript course. The assignment was to create a Tic Tac Toe game where both players use the same browser and take turns. We had one week to finish, and with this being my first full vue project, I had a lot of fun making it. The game is fully responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS. 

## Features

The game has the following features:

### Basic Features (Grade G)

- Ability to input player names for X and O

- Ability to resume game even after closing the browser
